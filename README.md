## Introduction

This CSS file intends to warn developers about **possible risks and mistakes** that exist in HTML code. It can also be used to roughly evaluate a site's quality by simply including it as an external stylesheet.

CSS files are available in French, English, Spanish, Greek, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese and Polish — and leveled or full.

## How to use?

### WebExtension

Either you're using [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/a11ycss/), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/a11ycss/lkehmahcnhddkdaemngepjckgcjnidpe) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/a11ycss/iolfinldndiiobhednboghogkiopppid?hl=en), you're invited to install and use [a11y.css's webextension — which has its own repository](https://github.com/ffoodd/a11y.css-webextension).

It provides some nice features not included in the main CSS file (for now), such as:

* force focus visibility;
* show lang attributes;
* check images' alternatives by displaying them;
* increase text spacings.

As a WebExtension, it also enables to:

* toggle CSS and change level on the fly, 
* remember settings for each tab,
* automatically update in the background.
